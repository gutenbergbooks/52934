</div>

<p class='c009'>In the city of Neuilly, just across the River Seine from
Paris, lives a remarkable woman, Countess Mary
Yourkevitch, a Russian by birth, French by adoption.
She has for many years devoted her life and spent her
income in the interest of the friendless horse, dog and cat.
No provisions being made by the French Government and
municipal authorities, these homeless dumb animals are
left to shift for themselves in case of sickness or distress.
She organized the Blue Cross Society of France and for
many years has been the President of this Society. She
secured grounds in a secluded spot of Neuilly and thereon
erected suitable buildings for the housing and care of her
homeless and suffering friends. Previously a social
leader, she has during these latter years relinquished all
social functions and thrown heart and soul into this commendable
work of relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1914, when France was drawn into what was to become
a world war, she set about to aid her adopted
country. Dogs of all breeds and descriptions were gathered
into the Refuge in Neuilly. A systematic training
school was organized to fit these dogs for war work, some
for the Red Cross, some for trench work, and still others
to become messengers to carry important documents and
light burdens. It was most essential that a dog for each
division of this work should be thoroughly trained, and
after this was accomplished the work became one of
routine and practice. The trained dogs became the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>instructors, and it was a stupid pupil indeed that did not
become more or less proficient in the work set for it in
the course of a week or ten days. To watch this training
process is most interesting. A green dog, that is, one
without any training, is attached by a short lead to the
dog instructor. The command is given to perform a certain
duty and at once the trained dog is off on his mission,
pulling the untrained dog with him. This is repeated time
and again until the pupil learns the word of command
and the execution of the same. It is but a question of a
few days until the green dog has learned his lessons, and
he himself becomes an instructor to some new arrival at
the home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six hundred dogs were thus instructed for their various
war duties and sent to the front. The war is now at an
end, and while many of these faithful creatures paid the
supreme sacrifice, hundreds are left, some crippled for
life, and all in need of proper care for the balance of their
lives. During my three months’ stay in Paris following
the armistice, dozens of these dogs were returned to the
Countess to be cared for. Knowing the burden placed
upon her, both in a financial and physical sense, I am
writing this story of the heroic deeds of these wonderful
animals. Every penny derived from the sale of this booklet
will be devoted to assist this noble work of the Countess
Yourkevitch of Neuilly, France.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>THE DOG’S MANIFOLD DUTIES AT THE</span></b> <br /> <b><span class='xlarge'>BATTLE FRONT</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The stories of the devotion of dogs to their masters
under the most trying conditions of the battlefront
form one of the epics of the great struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is said that there were about ten thousand dogs employed
at the battle front at the time of the signing of
the armistice. They ranged from Alaskan malamute to
St. Bernard, and from Scotch collie to fox terrier. Many
of them were placed on the regimental rosters like soldiers.
In the trenches they shared all the perils and hardships
of the soldiers themselves, and drew their turns in
the rest camps in the same fashion. But they were
always ready to go back and it is not recorded that a
single one of them ever failed when it came to “going
over the top.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Red Cross dogs rendered invaluable service in
feeding and aiding the wounded. Each one carried a first-aid
kit either strapped to its collar or in a small saddle
pouch. When they found a soldier who was unconscious,
they were taught to bring back his helmet, handkerchief
or some other small article as a token of discovery. Many
of them learned wholly to ignore the dead, but to bark
loudly whenever they came upon a wounded man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only did the dog figure gloriously as a messenger
of mercy in the war, but did his bit nobly as a sentinel in
the trenches. Mounting guard at a listening post for long
hours at a stretch, ignoring danger with all the stolidness
of a stoic, yet alert every moment, he played an heroic
role.</p>

<p class='c010'>Full many a time it was the keen ear of a collie that
first caught the sound of the approaching raiding party.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>And did he bark? How natural it would have been for
him to do so! But no, a bark or a growl might have told
the raiders they were discovered, and thus have prevented
the animal’s own forces from giving the foe a
counter-surprise. So he wagged his tail nervously—a
canine adaptation of the wig-wag system which his master
interpreted and acted upon, to the discomfiture of
the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Often whole companies were saved because the dog
could reach further into the distance with his senses than
could the soldiers themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was found that many dogs would do patrol and scout
duty with any detachment. But there was another type of
dog worker needed in the trenches—the liason dog,
trained to seek his master whenever turned loose. Amid
exploding shells, through veritable fields of hell, he would
crawl and creep, with only one thought—to reach his
master. Nor would he stop until the object of his search
was attained. Many a message of prime importance he
thus bore from one part of the field to another, and
nought but death or overcoming wound could turn him
aside.—The National Geographic Magazine.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>THE MESSENGER</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Early in the war the Germans realized the importance
of gaining possession of the French Coast of
the English Channel, and thus cut off communications
with England and prevent the landing of English soldiers
on French soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Germans selected Ypres as the point of their offensive
and the English were strongly resisting the drive.
Men on both sides were being mowed down by shell and
shrapnel. For many hours the incessant conflict raged, at
one time the Germans gaining vantage positions but to
give way before the bull-dog tenacity of the English. The
strong reinforcements on the German side convinced the
commanding officer of the English defensive that it must
be a question of short duration until the Germans would
achieve the desired objective, and they (the English)
would be compelled to retreat. The situation was a critical
one and unless the English were reinforced, the day
would be lost and the enemy would have a clear way to
Calais.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lying four miles to the rear were two divisions of the
English army ready to march to their assistance if required.
Quick action was necessary, as every moment
was golden. For a courier to cover this distance of four
miles and reach the commanding officer of the reserves,
close to an hour must be required, and no one could tell
what this hour might mean to the ever weakening defensive.
A message was quickly written and a messenger
dog called. The urgent call for assistance was placed in
the bag attached to the dog’s collar and he was given the
word to go. Just twenty minutes elapsed from the time
the dog was entrusted with the message until the officer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in command of the reserves had read the hurried call. The
camp resounded with the bugle call “To Arms” and in
ninety minutes from the time the message was despatched,
the front formation of the reinforcing divisions
was in active work. The Germans were driven back with
terrible slaughter, and the day was won for the English.</p>

<p class='c010'>An English journal in telling this story comments on
the event as follows: “Who can tell what might have
been the outcome of a victory for the enemy at this crucial
moment.” Hundreds of other instances could be recited
to show the vital importance of the war dogs’ work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>BIJOU</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At the breaking out of the war there lived in the little
town of Méru, twenty-five miles distant from Paris,
a man named Jacques Thallant. He had for a daily companion
a dog called Bijou, just a common every-day dog
of the French poodle breed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jacques was among the first to offer his services to his
country and was accepted. He requested the privilege of
taking Bijou with him and his request was granted.
Jacques was sent into active service and Bijou soon
accustomed himself to trench life, and with the soldiers
shared their army privations. Frequently Jacques was
placed on picket duty and Bijou was company for him
during the long tedious nights of watching.</p>

<p class='c010'>Picket duty is one of the most hazardous duties for
the soldier. During the day the enemy locates the picket
posts and it requires but little practice for a sharpshooter
to so train his gun as to do most effective and fatal work
at night by shooting at random. A cold, dismal night
found Jacques at a picket post with Bijou at his feet,
imparting warmth as well as companionship. This night
proved to be the last for poor Jacques, as my story will
tell. A shot rang out—a bullet sped on its deadly errand—Jacques
fell fatally wounded. His life blood was flowing
rapidly, and his mind turned to his wife and children
in far away Méru. He searched for paper and pencil and
found in his pocket a letter he had that day received
from his loved companion at home. Hastily he scrawled
on the envelope the story of his condition, and with weakening
hands he placed the same in the pouch attached to
Bijou’s collar, and in failing voice commanded him to go
home to his mistress. In the morning Jacques was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>cold in death, still grasping the pencil in his hand. Search
was made for the dog but he could not be found, and the
record was made “Jacques Thallant shot while on duty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Three hundred and more kilometers covered the distance
between Verdun and Méru. Early in the morning
of the third day after the soul of Jacques had passed beyond,
Mme. Thallant heard a noise without the house
and hurriedly dressing, reached the door just in time to
see the faithful dog’s death-glazing eyes brighten for an
instant, and then with a convulsive quiver his limbs
relaxed in death. On examination a bullet wound was
found in his groin and then they knew the agony he must
have endured in fulfilling his master’s last command. A
stray bullet doubtlessly dealt the death blow as he sped
to do his master’s bidding. For two days and three nights
he dragged himself onward with the entrusted message,
without food, without rest, true to the trust imposed in
him, until his work was accomplished and then——</p>

<p class='c010'>My old friend Hildevert Labrosse told me the story
with tears in his eyes, and together we walked down the
narrow street leading to the home of Widow Thallant.
He showed me the gate through which the dog had
dragged himself and up the walk to the house, and the
threshold of the door on which he died. They buried the
faithful creature in the corner of the yard near a shed
where he was wont to sleep at night and where his ever
faithful eyes could watch over the safety of his master’s
house. A small headboard with the simple inscription
“Bijou, Faithful Unto Death” marks the last resting place
of Jacques’ friend.</p>

<p>Monte, the Picket.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>“MONTE” THE PICKET</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thousands of soldiers have suffered from shell
shock, which proved to be one of the most trying
conditions for the hospital nurses—nerves keyed to the
highest tension for days at a time snapped under the
whizzing and bursting shells which rained destruction in
their midst. Horses frequently suffered from the ill
effects of this trying ordeal, but it was a rare occurrence
for the dog to be affected by these conditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the month of January following the armistice, two
French soldiers appeared at the Refuge accompanied by a
collie dog. This dog’s home had been in Montreuil, a
small town near Paris, and the soldiers had nicknamed
him “Monte.” For four years Monte had served at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>front as a picket dog. His nightly service was to accompany
a soldier assigned to picket duty, and there through
the long night he remained, ever alert to impending
dangers. His keen scent and hearing enabled him to
detect the slightest suspicious movement on the part of
the enemy, and many a brave soldier’s life was saved by
his timely warning. The bristling hairs on his body, his
erect ears, the swishing of his tail, quietly conveyed to his
master the approach of the enemy. The whistling, deadly
bullet was beyond his ken and fourteen times in six
weeks Monte returned to the lines alone. Each time they
found the picket either killed or wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>After four years of this nerve-racking service, Monte
was mustered out and returned with the two surviving
soldiers of the original company. He was suffering from
shell shock and returned to the Refuge as a patient. It
was really pitiful to watch him in his sufferings. Worn
out from physical weariness he would drop off into a
light sleep, when suddenly he would bound to his feet,
ears pointed and every individual hair on his body standing
erect. This was followed by severe trembling indicative
of shattered nerves.</p>

<p class='c010'>I made many attempts to photograph Monte, but with

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>“TOBY” THE RATTER</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of the many annoyances and discomforts of camp and
trench life, the rat is the most unwelcome. This
species of the rodent family infests these places and not
only becomes a pest, but a menace to the health of the soldier.
Many a brave man has lost his life from the poisonous
bite of these pesky and annoying creatures. Every effort
is made to rid the camp of their presence. Of all breeds
of dogs, the fox terrier has been found the most effective
in the destruction of rats, and many of these dogs have
earned wonderful reputations as “ratters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Refuge in Neuilly there is a dog named Toby,
who has passed into the professional rat-killer class.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>During his three years’ service at the front, four thousand
or more “dead ones” have been marked up to his credit,
and all previous records have been smashed.</p>

<p class='c010'>That the rat was not the only enemy that Toby encountered
during his service for his country, is evidenced by
his <i>gimp</i>. A stray bullet snipped one of his front feet off
just below the knee, and now Toby is listed as “wounded
but not inactive.” He is the most agile three-footed tyke
I ever saw, and sets the pace for all the other dogs in
their gambols about the grounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>The soldiers taught Toby many tricks, and on command
he says his prayers, rolls over, plays dead, speaks
(barks), sings and performs other “stunts” that are truly
wonderful.</p>

<p>Dick, the Guide.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>“DICK” THE GUIDE</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just a short distance from the Refuge for War Dogs in
Neuilly, is located the Soldiers’ Home for the Blind. This
is a spacious building surrounded by ample grounds containing
shrubbery, trees and flowers. Under the spreading
trees are comfortable benches for the accommodation of
the occupants of the Home. Hundreds of soldiers, rendered
totally blind during the war, are cared for, and
spend the days wandering through the grounds and enjoying
the comforts that such conditions afford.</p>

<p class='c010'>For two years, Dick, the subject of this sketch, has
served as a guide for these soldiers. He is a fine specimen
of the French poodle, large in size, gentle in disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>and perfectly familiar with the duties expected of him.
Early in the morning he reports for duty, and from then
on until the close of day he carefully leads and cares for
the sightless subjects delegated to his charge. It is no
unusual sight to see two men or more, arm in arm, being
guided by Dick through various parts of the grounds.
Sometimes you meet them picking their way through the
adjacent streets, Dick always on the alert for their safety.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had on frequent occasions to pass Dick on my way to
and from the dog hospital on Rue Chauveau, and in time
we became great friends. Just before leaving for my home
in America, I paid a final visit to my dog friends in
Neuilly, and was surprised to find Dick in the hospital
recovering from some temporary dog ailment. He joyfully
welcomed me as an old friend, and I expressed a
wish to the Countess that I might bring him to America.
She replied that Dick had certainly done his bit for his
country and that it was high time he enjoyed a little
of real dog life, and willingly consented that I should
have him. The short time until my departure prevented
me from obtaining the necessary permit to land him in
the United States. The Countess generously offered to
care for him until such time as proper arrangements
could be made for his trip from Paris to New York. Before
leaving I requested the Countess’ lady secretary to
instruct Dick in the English language, so that he would
be familiar with the speech of his adopted country.
Shortly afterwards I received the following card from this
young lady: “I told Dick a few days ago that his master
in America wished him to learn English, and Dick replied,
‘Tell my master to learn French, as I am a French
dog.’”—a very clever reply from either lady or dog.</p>

<p>Leon, a Red Cross Dog.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>LEON</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the most striking dog in the Home was
Leon, a wonderful mastiff, who towered head and
shoulders above his companions and was really majestic
when strolling around the grounds. He seemed to realize
that he occupied a position just a few points above the
ordinary dog, and his associates seemed to think the
same. Leon was a Red Cross dog, and his work during
the war was wholly in the line of Red Cross work. He
had been awarded the War Cross Star for his work in
this capacity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>He is possessed of what is known as a “glass eye,”
frequently seen in the horse, but rarely found in other
animals. One eye is the ordinary brown color, while the
other is a light blue color, together producing a very
striking effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only dogs of more than ordinary intelligence are fitted
for the varied branches of Red Cross work. Not only are
they required to carry first relief to the wounded, but also
to report back to headquarters, bringing with them evidences
of wounded soldiers in distress. When they found
a soldier who was unconscious, they were taught to bring
back some article of the wearing apparel of the man as
evidence of his discovery. Sometimes it would be a handkerchief
or his helmet, or in cases where these could not
be obtained, the dog has been known to gnaw off a button
from the unconscious man’s coat and offer this in evidence
of his find. Bursting shells and whistling bullets were
wholly ignored by these animal heroes as they went
about their mission.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following story was told me by Mrs. Rose Chilton,
a Red Cross nurse from New Orleans, La., which illustrates
the surprising intelligence and sagacity of these
dogs. “All day long a destructive battle had raged and our
boys had suffered severely from the raining shot. Leon
was busy here and there with his kit bag stored with first
aid supplies. Frequently he had returned to headquarters
for fresh supplies, or to bring back some token of a
wounded man in distress. Late in the night he returned
carrying in his mouth a soiled photograph. The picture
showed a splendid young man in khaki. On either knee
he held a lovely, smiling child, the younger about two
years of age, the elder four, while at his side sat a sweet
faced woman, with one hand resting lovingly on the boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>soldier’s shoulder. These three represented the sacrifice
the boy had made when he enlisted in a cause to make
his home sacred and safe for all time to come. A
searching party was at once despatched to bring back
the wounded soldier. Leon, with unerring instinct, led
the way and shortly brought the rescuing party to the
object of their search. The boy had been severely
wounded in the head, and was in an unconscious condition.
He had evidently wandered some distance
from the point where the accident had happened, as
he was without a helmet and his uniform was soiled by
mud and earth. Leon, finding no ready token for his
identification, had torn open his blouse and from an inner
pocket extracted the identifying photograph. Everything
was done for the sorely wounded boy, but a few hours
later his spirit took its flight to the unknown shores
beyond. Out in the State of Illinois a widowed wife and
two fatherless children mourn the loss of husband and
father.”</p>

<p>Wolf, Police Dog.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>WOLF</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The advisability of using dogs in the war was under
consideration by the United States War Department
for many months. Provision had been made for the training
of these dogs, and in fact many had been mustered
into service, when a final decision was reached to eliminate
their use.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1914, just a few weeks before war was declared, I
purchased in the city of Neuremberg, Bavaria, a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>specimen of the German Police dog. The reader can see
by the picture of this animal that he was by no means an
ordinary dog, but one of the finest specimens of this
famous breed. Wolf stood 28½ inches from fore feet to
shoulder blades and weighed 170 pounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through a fellow member of the Police Dog Club of
America, who had been commissioned by the U. S. Government
as official trainer, I had Wolf enlisted for war
service and he was sent to Athens, Georgia, to complete
his training. After the War Department concluded to
debar war dog service, he was turned over to the French
War Department, and in December, 1917, was sent to
France. In June, 1918, I received a picture of Wolf, showing
him in camp in company with two French soldiers,
apparently enjoying the novel experience of fighting with
the enemies of his native land.</p>

<p class='c010'>During my stay in France following the armistice, I
spent many days and dollars in my efforts to discover the
whereabouts of my old friend Wolf, but all without avail.
Great difficulties were encountered in locating missing
men, and naturally my task to find a dog was much
greater. On my return to France I shall continue my
efforts and still hope to meet with success. When I find
him—and I pray that I may—Wolf shall spend his declining
days in the enjoyment of everything a dog likes best,
and when his days are ended, he shall have bestowed upon
him a decent burial and the lasting memories of his
master.</p>

<p>Huskie, Alaskan Dog.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>THE “HUSKIE”</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>During the summer of 1918 I spent two months in
Alaska, and while there became familiar with the
characteristics of the Alaskan Eskimo dog.</p>

<p class='c010'>Travel during the long sunless winter season would be
next to impossible were it not for these tireless sled dogs.
Summer is their vacation period and they wander through
the villages, camps and mountains, much as the ordinary
farm or country dog, spending the long hours of constant
sunshine playing and sleeping. From the moment of the
first fall of snow, play and sleep, become—if a dog ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>thinks—but a thing of memory, as work is then the order
of the day and dogs instead of horses transport burdens
of every description. To the hustling Alaskan, a team of
sled dogs is the most important asset in his possession.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the approach of winter, the armies of the Allies
were confronted with a very serious problem, namely,
how to supply the troops in the mountain camps and
trenches with sufficient food supply. Motors and horses
were alike powerless to overcome these conditions. Falling
snows and howling blizzards made the work of provisioning
these soldiers an impossibility. Hundreds of
dogs were sent from Alaska and Labrador, and these
hitched to sleds loaded with food and munitions made
their way through the mountain passes and over pinnacles,
relieving the threatened destruction of thousands
by starvation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ernest Harold Baynes, in the National Geographic
Magazine, has this to say relative to the work accomplished
by these dogs. “One woman brought back to
America a Croix de Guerre awarded by France to her
intrepid teams of sled dogs. The occasion that won them
that honor was their salvation of a stormbound, foe
pressed outpost in the French Alps. Despatch bearers
had been sent back repeatedly, but no succoring answer
came, for the messengers were overwhelmed as they
passed through the blinding blizzard. At last matters
became desperate. The foe was pressing his advantage
with dash and courage, and nothing but quick action
could save the situation. So Lieutenant Rene Haas
hitched his dogs to a light sled and started through a
blizzard before which human flesh, in spite of the ‘urge’
of a consecrated patriotism, had failed. In ‘sweepstakes
racing time’ they covered the trip down the mountain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>over a perilous pass to the main army post. There twenty-eight
dogs were hitched to fourteen light sleds, and
these were loaded with ammunition. Back over the forbidding
trail they went, under an artillery fire, facing a
bitter wind, and plowing through blinding clouds of
snow. On the fifth day at sunrise the panting malamutes
reached the outpost, their burden of ammunition was
rushed to the gunners, and the mountain was saved from
the foe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We must all agree that the “Huskie” takes his place of
honor among the many other species of dogdom who did
his bit in the World War, and if it is true that he is a
lineal descendant of the timber wolf, we must even have
a higher respect for this much maligned animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>During my stay in France I wrote a number of
letters to the press relating to the work of the Blue
Cross Society of France, and in return received many interesting
letters from America, and in many instances
donations for the Refuge.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the most pleasing was the following, which
demonstrates the heart and spirit of the boys and girls
of our great and generous country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Livingston Avenue, Dobbs Ferry, N. Y.</p>
<p class='c012'>John I. Anderson,</p>
<p class='c011'>Continental Hotel, Paris, France.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dear Sir:</p>

<p class='c013'>Your appeal for the wounded dogs now being
cared for in the hospital in Neuilly, France,
which appeared in the New York Globe, was
brought to the attention of the children of the
Presbyterian Church of this town, and they decided
to do something themselves to raise a little
money.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five youngsters equipped their dogs with
white blankets and collection boxes and spent
Saturday asking dog lovers to give something
for the little war sufferers. When the boxes were
opened they found $18.00, which I am forwarding
to you. A donation of $2.50 was made by the
Dramatic Club of the Presbyterian Church,
bringing the total to $20.50, for which amount
my check is drawn to your order.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The children would very much appreciate any
particulars which you can furnish them regarding
these “little soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Very truly yours,</p>

<p class='c015'>Margaret M. Link.</p>

<p class='c012'>February 25, 1919.</p>

<p class='c010'>This help from America has wonderfully encouraged
the Countess in her philanthropic work among the crippled,
sick and needy dumb animals, and it is her desire to
extend the work to other parts of France, where inestimable
good can be accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='xlarge'>SENATOR VEST’S ADDRESS TO A JURY</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A poor man in the State of Missouri owned a dog,
his constant companion. A churlish neighbor, without
provocation, killed the dog. Too poor to prosecute the
offender, the man was without redress. United States
Senator Vest of Missouri was informed of the circumstances
and at once offered his services, without pay, to
prosecute the case. The offender was summoned to court
and the following plea was made before a jury of twelve
men. Without leaving their seats these twelve men unanimously
agreed upon a verdict of a $500.00 penalty against
the defendant. The following was Senator Vest’s address
to the jury:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen of the Jury: The best friend a man has in
this world may turn against him and become his enemy.
His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care
may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and
dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness
and our good name, may become traitors to their faith.
The money that a man has he may lose. It flies away from
him, perhaps when he needs it most. A man’s reputation
may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action.
The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us
honor when success is with us may be the first to throw
the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our
heads. The one absolute, unselfish friend that a man can
have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him,
the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is
his dog.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen of the Jury: A man’s dog stands by him in
prosperity and poverty, in health and in sickness. He will
sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and the snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his
master’s side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to
offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in
encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards
the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince.
When all other friends desert he remains. When riches
take wings and reputation falls to pieces he is as constant
in his love as the sun in its journey through the
heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in
the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks
no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to
guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and
when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the
master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the
cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their
way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found,
his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open and in
alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
